### **Software Release Life Cycle (SRLC)**  

The **Software Release Life Cycle (SRLC)** refers to the stages a software product goes through from initial development to its final release and maintenance. It ensures that software is developed, tested, deployed, and maintained systematically.

---

## **Phases of the Software Release Life Cycle**

### **1. Pre-Alpha (Development Phase)**
- **Activities:** Initial coding, designing, and unit testing.
- **Testing:** Limited to developers and internal testers.
- **Goal:** Develop a working prototype or MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

---

### **2. Alpha Phase (Internal Testing)**
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct in-house testing to identify major bugs.
  - Functional and usability testing.
- **Testing Audience:** Internal developers and testers.
- **Goal:** Fix major issues before external testing.

---

### **3. Beta Phase (External Testing)**
- **Activities:**
  - Software is released to real users outside the development team.
  - Collects real-world feedback and performance insights.
- **Types of Beta Testing:**
  - **Closed Beta:** Limited group of users.
  - **Open Beta:** Publicly available to a larger user base.
- **Goal:** Identify bugs, usability issues, and gather feedback for improvements.

---

### **4. Release Candidate (RC) / Gamma Testing**
- **Activities:**
  - Software is nearly complete with all major issues fixed.
  - Final testing is performed before public release.
- **Goal:** Ensure stability and readiness for production.

---

### **5. General Availability (GA) / Production Release**
- **Activities:**
  - Software is officially released to all users.
  - Available for purchase/download.
- **Goal:** Deliver a stable and functional product.

---

### **6. Maintenance & Updates**
- **Activities:**
  - Regular updates, patches, and bug fixes.
  - Performance improvements and security updates.
- **Types of Updates:**
  - **Patch Release:** Small fixes for critical issues.
  - **Minor Update:** Feature enhancements and minor fixes.
  - **Major Update:** Significant improvements or redesigns.
- **Goal:** Ensure continued software reliability and user satisfaction.

## **Beta Testing Strategies & Tools for Alpha/Beta Testing**

### **Beta Testing Strategies**
To ensure an effective Beta testing phase, different strategies can be applied based on the product type, target users, and testing goals.

### **1. Open Beta vs. Closed Beta**
- **Closed Beta** – Limited to a selected group of users, often under NDA (e.g., early adopters, premium customers).
- **Open Beta** – Available to the public, allowing a large user base to test the software.

### **2. Technical Beta**
- Focuses on performance, security, and integration testing.
- Often conducted with IT professionals or developers.

### **3. Marketing Beta**
- Used to generate hype around the product.
- Invites influencers, media, and key stakeholders to test and share reviews.

### **4. Focused Beta**
- Targets specific features or functionalities.
- Helps refine a particular aspect of the product.

### **5. Post-release Beta**
- Conducted after the official release to continue gathering feedback.
- Helps with ongoing improvements and future updates.
