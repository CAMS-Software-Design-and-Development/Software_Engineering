### **Software Release Life Cycle (SRLC)**  

The **Software Release Life Cycle (SRLC)** refers to the stages a software product goes through from initial development to its final release and maintenance. It ensures that software is developed, tested, deployed, and maintained systematically.

## **Phases of the Software Release Life Cycle**

### **1. Pre-Alpha (Development Phase)**
- **Activities:** Initial coding, designing, and unit testing.
- **Testing:** Limited to developers and internal testers.
- **Goal:** Develop a working prototype or MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

---

### **2. Alpha Phase (Internal Testing)**
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct in-house testing to identify major bugs.
  - Functional and usability testing.
- **Testing Audience:** Internal developers and testers.
- **Goal:** Fix major issues before external testing.

---

### **3. Beta Phase (External Testing)**
- **Activities:**
  - Software is released to real users outside the development team.
  - Collects real-world feedback and performance insights.
- **Types of Beta Testing:**
  - **Closed Beta:** Limited group of users.
  - **Open Beta:** Publicly available to a larger user base.
- **Goal:** Identify bugs, usability issues, and gather feedback for improvements.

---

### **4. Release Candidate (RC) / Gamma Testing**
- **Activities:**
  - Software is nearly complete with all major issues fixed.
  - Final testing is performed before public release.
- **Goal:** Ensure stability and readiness for production.

---

### **5. General Availability (GA) / Production Release**
- **Activities:**
  - Software is officially released to all users.
  - Available for purchase/download.
- **Goal:** Deliver a stable and functional product.

---

### **6. Maintenance & Updates**
- **Activities:**
  - Regular updates, patches, and bug fixes.
  - Performance improvements and security updates.
- **Types of Updates:**
  - **Patch Release:** Small fixes for critical issues.
  - **Minor Update:** Feature enhancements and minor fixes.
  - **Major Update:** Significant improvements or redesigns.
- **Goal:** Ensure continued software reliability and user satisfaction.

### **Summary of Software Release Life Cycle Stages**
| Stage | Testing Level | Audience | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Pre-Alpha** | Unit Testing | Developers | Initial coding & prototyping |
| **Alpha** | Internal Testing | QA Team | Detect major bugs |
| **Beta** | External Testing | Real Users | Gather feedback & usability insights |
| **Release Candidate (RC)** | Final Testing | Limited Release | Ensure stability before full launch |
| **General Availability (GA)** | Production | Public Users | Official software release |
| **Maintenance & Updates** | Continuous | All Users | Bug fixes & improvements |
