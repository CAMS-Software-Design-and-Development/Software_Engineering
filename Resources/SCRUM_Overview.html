<h1>SCRUM<a class="headerlink" href="#scrum" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>SCRUM is an Agile framework used to manage complex product development. It emphasizes iterative progress, collaboration, and adaptability. Here’s a breakdown of the SCRUM phases, along with documentation that should be created or maintained during each phase:</p>
<section id="backlog-product-backlog">
<h2>1. <strong>Backlog (Product Backlog)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#backlog-product-backlog" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What happens</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> creates and manages the <strong>Product Backlog</strong>, which is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, bug fixes, or technical improvements that need to be done for the project. These items are usually called <strong>Product Backlog Items (PBIs)</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The team collaboratively refines the backlog, breaking larger tasks into smaller, actionable pieces.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Product Backlog</strong>: A list of all desired work items.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backlog Refinement Notes</strong>: Any changes or additional information added during backlog grooming meetings.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sprint-planning">
<h2>2. <strong>Sprint Planning</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#sprint-planning" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What happens</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <strong>Sprint</strong> is a time-boxed period, typically 1–4 weeks, where a specific set of work items from the backlog are worked on.</p></li>
<li><p>During <strong>Sprint Planning</strong>, the team selects high-priority backlog items to work on during the sprint. They break down these tasks into actionable steps.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Scrum Master</strong> facilitates the session, ensuring the team has everything they need to succeed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: The set of items from the product backlog that will be worked on during the sprint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sprint Goal</strong>: The objective the team aims to achieve during the sprint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Task Breakdown</strong>: A detailed breakdown of the selected work items into smaller tasks.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="to-do-sprint-backlog">
<h2>3. <strong>To-Do (Sprint Backlog)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#to-do-sprint-backlog" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What happens</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>To-Do</strong> list is typically a section of the <strong>Sprint Backlog</strong> that contains tasks the team has planned to start but hasn’t yet worked on. It provides visibility into upcoming tasks for the sprint.</p></li>
<li><p>These tasks are often broken down into smaller actionable items that are easy to track.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: This document should list all tasks that have yet to be started during the sprint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Task Descriptions</strong>: Clear descriptions of each individual task to avoid confusion.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="doing-in-progress">
<h2>4. <strong>Doing (In Progress)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#doing-in-progress" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What happens</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The team works on the tasks they selected during <strong>Sprint Planning</strong>. This is the “doing” phase, where active development occurs. Each task is moved from <strong>To-Do</strong> to <strong>Doing</strong> as work begins.</p></li>
<li><p>The team often has daily <strong>Stand-up (Daily Scrum)</strong> meetings to sync up on progress, address blockers, and adjust plans.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Task Updates</strong>: As work progresses, team members update task status, adding notes on progress, challenges, and next steps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Burndown Chart</strong>: A visual representation of remaining work in the sprint, showing the team’s progress.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="review">
<h2>5. <strong>Review</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#review" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What happens</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At the end of the sprint, a <strong>Sprint Review</strong> meeting occurs where the team demonstrates the work completed during the sprint. This is done for the stakeholders, including the Product Owner.</p></li>
<li><p>The team discusses what went well, challenges faced, and what wasn’t completed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Sprint Review Notes</strong>: A document or presentation summarizing the work completed, feedback from stakeholders, and any items that need to be adjusted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completed Product Backlog Items</strong>: Items that were completed during the sprint and can potentially be shipped or deployed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release Notes</strong> (optional): If the product is being released after the sprint, this includes updates and changes made during the sprint.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="done-sprint-retrospective">
<h2>6. <strong>Done (Sprint Retrospective)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#done-sprint-retrospective" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What happens</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong> is a meeting held after the Sprint Review, where the team reflects on the sprint itself. The focus is on <strong>process improvement</strong>—what worked well, what didn’t, and how things can be improved in future sprints.</p></li>
<li><p>The team agrees on actions to take in the next sprint to improve their processes and work together more effectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Sprint Retrospective Notes</strong>: Actionable items from the retrospective that are intended to improve the team’s workflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Items</strong>: Specific improvements or adjustments the team will make in the next sprint.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="overall-scrum-documentation-considerations">
<h2>Overall SCRUM Documentation Considerations:<a class="headerlink" href="#overall-scrum-documentation-considerations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Product Backlog</strong>: The entire product roadmap, which evolves throughout the project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: More focused on a particular sprint’s work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Burndown Chart</strong>: Tracks work completion over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sprint Review and Retrospective Notes</strong>: Helps the team stay aligned and continuously improve their processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Definition of Done (DoD)</strong>: The criteria that must be met for work to be considered “done,” typically agreed upon by the team during the retrospective.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SCRUM emphasizes continuous inspection and adaptation, so while documentation exists, it is generally minimal and lightweight compared to traditional project management approaches. The focus is on delivering working software and having efficient communication rather than producing heavy documentation.</p>
</section>
<section id="scrum-master">

While the Scrum Master does not have authority over the team members, their primary focus is on enabling the team to be as effective as possible in delivering the product increment.</p>
