### Rubric Breakdown:
1. **Clarity & Focus**: Assesses how well the participant communicates updates, staying on topic and delivering relevant information (what was done, what’s next, and any blockers). A "4" represents clear, focused communication, while a "1" reflects vague or off-topic updates.

2. **Participation & Engagement**: Evaluates how involved the individual is during the SCRUM. A "4" means active participation and engagement, while a "1" indicates little to no involvement.

3. **Problem-Solving & Collaboration**: Measures whether the participant recognizes obstacles and works to solve them, while also collaborating with team members. A "4" reflects proactive issue resolution and support, while a "1" indicates a lack of collaboration or problem-solving.

4. **Timeliness & Time Management**: Evaluates how well the participant manages their time during the SCRUM. A "4" represents efficient time management, while a "1" indicates the participant is frequently causing delays or taking too long to deliver their update.

This rubric can help assess individual performance in daily SCRUM meetings and ensure that team members remain focused, engaged, and collaborative throughout the Agile process.
